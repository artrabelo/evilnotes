			<p>Hi, you can call me Art. This is some kind of a minimal blog, I don't know yet. But I like the sound of it.</p>
			<p>I'm coding this website by hand to learn HTML and CSS, stuff I already messed with before but never for real. There won't be any flashing images or autoplay media here cause I want it to be flat, minimal and responsive, something that could be comfortable to access in mobile or a text-browser like w3m.</p>
			<p>Even so, there's absolutely nothing important here, but feel free to hang around and take a look at these nasty notes.</p>
