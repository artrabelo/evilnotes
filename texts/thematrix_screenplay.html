		<h1>Wake up, Neo</h1>
		<hr>
		<main>
			<p class="action">Swallowed by DARKNESS.</p>
			<p class="action">The DARKNESS CRACKLES with phosphorescent energy, the word "searching" blazing in around us as we EMERGE FROM a computer screen.</p>
			<p class="action">The screen flickers with windowing data as a search engine runs with a steady relentless rhythm.</p>
			<p class="action">We DRIFT BACK FROM the screen and INTO --</p>
			<p class="location">INT. NEO'S APARTMENT</p>
			<p class="action">It is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with technology.</p>
			<p class="action">Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks. Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse.</p>
			<p class="action">At the center of this technological rat-nest is NEO, a man who knows more about living inside a computer than outside one.</p>
			<p class="action">He is asleep in front of his PC. Behind him, the computer screen suddenly goes blank. A prompt appears: "Wake up, Neo."</p>
			<p class="action">Neo's eye pries open. He sits up, one eye still closed, looking around, unsure of where he is. He notices the screen.</p>
			<p class="action">He types "CTRL X" but the letter "T" appears.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">What...?</p>
			<p class="action">He hits another and an "H" appears. He keeps typing, pushing random functions and keys while the computer types out a message as though it had a mind of its own.</p>
			<p class="action">He stops and stares at the four words on the screen: "The Matrix has you."</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">What the hell?</p>
			<p class="action">He hits the "ESC" button. Another message appears: "Follow the white rabbit."</p>
			<p class="action">He hits it again and the message repeats. He rubs his eyes but when he opens them, there is another message: "Knock, knock, Neo."</p>
			<p class="action">Someone KNOCKS on his door and he almost jumps out of his chair. He looks back at the computer, but the screen is now blank.</p>
			<p class="action">Someone KNOCKS again. Neo rises, still unnerved.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Who is it?</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI (O.S)</p>
			<p class="dialogue">It's Choi.</p>
			<p class="action">Neo flips a series of locks and opens the door, leaving the chain on. A young Chinese MAN stands there with several of his friends.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">You're two hours late.</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI (MAN)</p>
			<p class="dialogue">I know. It's her fault.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">You got the money?</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Two grand.</p>
			<p class="action">He takes out an envelope and gives it to Neo through the cracked door.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Hold on.</p>
			<p class="action">He closes the door. On the floor near his bed is a book, Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulations. The book has been hollowed out and inside are several computer disks. He takes one, sticks the money in the book and drops it on the floor.</p>
			<p class="action">Opening the door, he hands the disk to Choi.</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Hallelujah! You are my Savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">If you get caught using that --</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI</p>
			<p class="dialogue">I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Right...</p>
			<p class="action">Neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly returns.</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Something wrong, man? You look a little whiter than usual.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">I don't know... My computer...</p>
			<p class="action">He looks back at Choi, unable to explain what just happened.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI</p>
			<p class="dialogue">All the time. It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.</p>
			<p class="action">He smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog.</p>
			<p class="actor">CHOI</p>
			<p class="dialogue">It sounds to me like you need to unplug, man. A little R&R. What do you think, Dujour, should we take him with us?</p>
			<p class="actor">DUJOUR</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Definitely.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">I can't. I have to work tomorrow.</p>
			<p class="actor">DUJOUR</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Come on. It'll be fun. I promise.</p>
			<p class="action">He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins: bands, symbols, slogans, military medals and --</p>
			<p class="action">A small white rabbit. The ROOM TILTS.</p>
			<p class="actor">NEO</p>
			<p class="dialogue">Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go.</p>
